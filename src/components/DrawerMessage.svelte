  The default settings are a good starting point for most images. But be careful
  when tweaking them, as some settings can create huge SVG files. You can upload
  images of any size, but big images will result in huge SVGs. Importing these giant
  SVGs into Penpot might slow things down. In any case, the performance of Penpot
  and the plugin, mostly depends on your computer and browser, so, enjoy it, but
  use it with caution.
