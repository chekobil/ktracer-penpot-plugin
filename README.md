This app is using the awesome technology from [VisionCortex](https://github.com/visioncortex/vtracer)

# Roadmap

- [ ] Limit the maximum input image size, or at least warn the user.
- [ ] Try to get the image directly from Penpot, instead of uploading it (ask Penpot if its possible).
- [ ] Get the image from a URL.
- [ ] Make some presets for some common use cases (like logos, illustrations, etc).
- [ ] Easy access to settings, in options like, more colors, less forms, more defined, etc ...
